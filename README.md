## Description
This is a webpage to help you learn and research about different types of pokemon. It will tell you what type of Pokemon they are, their attributes, their card id and also what powers they use. When you type a Pokemon name in the search bar it will bring up a card of information and a short video about that one Pokemon. Also when clicked on a button under the video it will bring up a video of the top 10 Pokemons about that specfic type. We wanted to make a page that would sway you into liking Pokemon or to help you build a dream team to make you become a PokeMaster!
